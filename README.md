# LDLT Viewer

This is a repo for the html files for the LDLT Viewer, an interface for viewing LDLT editions online. 
The interface is itself an implementation of [CETEIcean](https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean), 
a research project of [Hugh Cayless](https://github.com/hcayless) and [Raffaele Viglianti](https://github.com/raffazizzi).

The interface provides a basic navigation menu; an interactive apparatus criticus that allows dynamic
swapping of variant readings into and out of the main text; filters for
types of variants; and dynamically generated lexical and morphological
analysis, courtesy of the [Alpheios project](https://alpheios.net/).
